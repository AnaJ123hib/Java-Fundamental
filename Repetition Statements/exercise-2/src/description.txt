The Ministries of Education and Health wish to keep statistics on the weights of students
in a state school according to the following ranges:

• Students under 40 kg.
• Students between 40 and 50 kg.
• Students over 50 and under 60 kg.
• Students over or equal to 60 kg.

Taking into account that the state school does not have more than 50 students, create an
application in Java that, first, receives the number of students in the classroom as data
and then allows the registration of their weight for each student.
The application should show as a result the number of students there are for each of the
ranges for which statistics are desired.
